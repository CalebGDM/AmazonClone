# AmazonClone
A very simple clone of `Amazon` that it should do all the basic stuff such as: user auth, creating product and adding it to a database,
makes a list of products that is displayed on the app and also be able to manage payments with stripe. I'm developing this clone with React Native, Expo, TypeScript but in the future i want to add more technologies.
#### Project Status
This project is still being developed but I will try to make the greatest progress possible.
